This was the game I made for [my first game jam](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam2ndedition). It was a really fun experience, especially since it got me to learn how A* pathfinding actually works.
The game itself was made in about 2 days and one night, but since then it might have gone through some updates.

It was made using the Unity game engine.
